# 🌞 Summer Chores Project

This project demonstrates **asynchronous programming** in JavaScript using three different techniques:
1. **Callbacks**
2. **Promises**
3. **Async/Await**

Each version simulates a person completing a series of summer chores, each taking a different amount of time.  
The program also includes a small random chance that the person “falls asleep” and doesn’t complete the next chore — demonstrating how to handle both success and failure in asynchronous code.
