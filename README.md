# 🌞 Summer Chores (Callback and Promise Versions)

This project demonstrates **asynchronous programming** in JavaScript using both **callbacks** and **Promises**.

Each file simulates a series of chores that take different amounts of time to complete.  
There’s also a random chance the person might "fall asleep" and stop before finishing all chores.
