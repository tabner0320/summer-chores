# 🧺 Summer Chores

This project demonstrates using **callbacks** in JavaScript to simulate asynchronous tasks — in this case, completing a list of summer chores one by one.

## 🧠 Description
Each “chore” (like cleaning or mowing) runs asynchronously using `setTimeout()`, and when each finishes, the next one starts using a callback function.  
The program demonstrates control flow using nested callbacks.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tabner0320/summer-chores.git
